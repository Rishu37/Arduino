# Arduino Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects demonstrating various functionalities and concepts related to robotics, sensors, and control systems. Each project is designed to teach and implement different aspects of hardware interfacing and embedded systems programming.

## Projects

### 1. **90_Degree_Spider.ino**
A robotic spider that moves its legs with 90-degree precision, mimicking the movement of a real spider.

### 2. **Analog_Write.ino**
Demonstrates how to use `analogWrite()` to control the brightness of an LED or the speed of a motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

### 3. **Black_White_Surface_Detect.ino**
Uses an IR sensor to detect black or white surfaces, triggering an LED as an indicator.

### 4. **Counter.ino**
A simple push-button counter, displaying the count on the serial monitor each time the button is pressed.

### 5. **LED_Chaser_Analog.ino**
Creates a sequential LED chaser effect with smooth transitions, controlling the brightness using PWM.

### 6. **LED_DIGITAL_INPUT_BUTTON.ino**
A basic setup for controlling an LED with a button, demonstrating the use of digital input/output functions.

### 7. **LED_POT.ino**
Adjusts the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer to vary the analog input.

### 8. **Line_Following_Car.ino**
Code for a line-following robot that uses sensors to detect and follow a line on the ground.

### 9. **Motor_Driver_L298N.ino**
Controls DC motors using the L298N motor driver module, allowing for forward and backward movement.

### 10. **OLED_With_Microwave_Sensor.ino**
Integrates an OLED display with a microwave sensor to show real-time sensor data.

### 11. **Otto_Walking.ino**
Controls the walking movement of an Otto robot, utilizing servos to mimic human-like steps.

### 12. **RGB_LED.ino**
Controls an RGB LED, changing its color by varying the values of the red, green, and blue components.

### 13. **ROBOCAR_Ultra.ino**
Manages an autonomous robot car using ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles.

### 14. **ROBO_UltraSSonic.ino**
Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect distances and make decisions for obstacle avoidance in a robotic setup.

### 15. **Serial_Input_Terminal.ino**
Allows control of Arduino functions via serial input, accepting commands to execute specific actions.

### 16. **TWO_WAY_TRAFFIC_LIGHT.ino**
Simulates a two-way traffic light system, controlling the traffic flow in both directions using LEDs.

### 17. **UltraSonic_Smart_Alert_System.ino**
A smart alert system that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby objects and trigger an alarm.
